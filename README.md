# Flood-analysis-using-Logistic-Regression
India is exceptionally defenseless, as the majority of its topographical territory is inclined to yearly flooding. The high misfortunes and harms because of floods show the helpless variation and alleviation status of India and deficiency in calamity the board and readiness.It’s important to take proper measures in order to avoid the disastrous outcomes of the flooding. It is important to minimise the loss of life and the loss of infrastructure. Both these factors affect the country and make it difficult for it’s revival. So, for this it is essential to be prepared beforehand.Therefore, in this project we approach flood analysis and management along India’s coastline with the help of a mathematical model.
